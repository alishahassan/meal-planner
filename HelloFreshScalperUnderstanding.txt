HelloFresh has a page with all recipes sorted alphabetically
    https://www.hellofresh.com/pages/sitemap/recipes-a
    only change for each letter of alphabet is last character in url

    all recipes are stored after 'Recipe Name Starts with A' for each letter
    can make a dict that is like { a:A , b:B, ... , z:Z }
    run a loop that stores all the links that is under that tag

    After we have a giant list, iterate through the list and gather all info we need link by link


On the page of the recipe
    get 'Total Time'
    get 'Difficulty'
    get 'Allergens' // What allergens it contains
    get 'Nutrition Values' // Entire section with different details
            'Calories'
            'Fat' 
            'Saturated Fat'
            'Carbohydrate'
            'Sugar'
            'Dietary Fiber'
            'Protein'
            'Cholesterol'
            'Sodium'
    get 'Ingredients' // Entire section with different 
            'serving amount' // just record number its On
            Various ingredients // different measurements
            Need to also ready 'Not included in your delivery' section
    get 'Cooking Steps'
            Its broken down by steps so take number
                then take the text associated with it
    

Not recommended:
    In case the scalper doesn't work, doing ctrl+u gives the html for the page and it has 
        all the info on the last line, just very difficult to get to
    Example: 


Doesn't work with inspection
